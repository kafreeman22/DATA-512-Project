## Project Description
### Project Part 2
The goal of this project is to analyze how total housing listing count was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with a scope limited to Fort Bend County, Texas. Ideally, this project will allow reviewers to draw inferences from the results such to formulate conclusions to be tested against others in a pragmatic ethical fashion. 

### Research Question
How were total housing market listings influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic?
### Hypotheses
**Hypothesis 1:** I predict that a time lag of two months will occur between the slope of confirmed COVID-19 cases and total market listings present in Fort Bend County, Texas
**Hypothesis 2:** I predict every 25% change in the slope of confirmed COVID-19 cases will result in a 5% decrease in total market listings in Fort Bend County, Texas. 


### Project Part 1
The goal of this project portion is to analyze how masking policies altered the progression of COVID-19 in Fort Bend County, Texas. Unfortunately, there were no mandates put in place for this specific county, so instead I focused on plotting the total-confirmed cases alongside their derivation. Additionally, I included the breakpoints for the data as well as the date of the COVID-19 vacination rollout. Lastly, the self-reported statistics from [this](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/mask-use) survey are included within the plot as well.
